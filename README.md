# Digits-and-letters-classifier

This projects aims to develop a classifier handwritten letters and digits based on a real database. The database used to train, validate and test the model was based on handwritten letters and digits (uppercase and lowercase).
The algorithm was developed based on a deep learning architecture using the framework Keras in Python. The Adam optimizer was chosen, as well as the categorical crossentropy for the loss with a decreasing learning rate at each epoch.
